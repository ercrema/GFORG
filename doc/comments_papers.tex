Some papers and comments:

\section{An evolutionary analysis of the volunteer's dilemma}

Myatt \& Wallace, 2008, Games and Economic Behavior, 62, 67-76

The authors note that noisy strategy evaluations are responsible for the evolution of the game. From what I understand, this is exactly the same thing as to implement a mutation mechanism. I'm not sure whether it is too artificial...

\section{Volunteer's Dilemma}

Diekmann, 1985, Journal of Conflict Resoliution, vol. 29, 4, 605-610

\emph{'For given group soze N, both [models] predict that the probability of defection is a monotonically increasing function of the cost-benefit ratio'}
